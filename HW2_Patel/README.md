<h1> Homework 2 </h1>

* Ensure to retrieve `train` and `test` data.
* Use `pip` library to install all the libraries listed in the program such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn.
* Part A of Homework 2 is the `Decision_Tree.py` file.
* Part B of Homework 2 is the `Crime_Predication.py` file.
* There are two ways to run python files, you can either run an executable or use an IDE such as PyCharm to run the files.
* Executable
  * Open terminal
  * Go to the path where these files are stored
  * Simply run `py Decision_Tree.py` and `py Crime_Prediction.py`
* Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  * Install `PyCharm` (If you haven't installed). Community version should be fine
  * Click `open` to open a folder in PyCharm
  * Simply double-click the two files
  * On the top right corner, there should be a green play button commonly referred as `run` or right click and click `run <filename>`.
  * This should allow you to run both files.

Note: both files are independent, so the order in which you run is irrelavant.
